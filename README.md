# Logoids

Logoids is an [Asteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)) clone where *you* provide the Asteroids!

Logoids scans the directory `images` for [PNG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics) files and uses the images it finds as the asteroids that will appear in the game. For best results, your asteroid images should have a transparent background and be approximately circular.

There are some terrible asteroid images supplied :)

Logoids is written using [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org/). To run it, you just type `love .` while in the Logoids directory.
